				<h2>WHY SHOULD WE ALL RECYCLE?</h2>
				<p><br>Recycling is important because manufacturers can use recycled materials to make packaging and it helps reduce natural resources from being harvested, thereby lessening CO2 emissions and the amount of plastic waste going into the ocean.</p>
				<p><br>Here are some facts about recycling:</p>
				<li>The average person in North American creates about 220 pounds of plastic waste each year and 4.40 pounds of waste everyday (according to the EPA).</li>
				<li>“Americans alone use 500 million straws daily.” (National Park Service)</li>
				<li>The U.S. creates about 8 million tons of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean.</li>
				<li>“Americans throw away enough office paper each year to build a 12 foot high wall from Seattle to NY (a new wall every year).” (Recycle Across America)</li>
				<li>In 2018 the U.S. generated 17 million tons of textiles and 2.5 million of it was recycled and 11.3 million of it went to the landfill. (EPA)</li>
				<li>Recycling a single aluminum can saves enough energy to power a TV for three hours.</li>

				<h3>Can You Recycle That?</h3>
				<p><br>First, check your item to see what kind of recycle symbol is on it → 1-7.<br>Second, if the item has food grease or other food remnants → rinse + dry before recycling.<br>Finally, loosely recycle the item (this means do not bag your recyclables). If you cannot recycle the item in your curbside bin find a recycling center near you and see if they will take that item.<br></p>
				<p><br><a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/what-recycling-symbols-mean-4126251#:~:text=The%20series%20of%20recycling%20symbols,and%20how%20recyclable%20it%20is.&text=Each%20number%20represents%20a%20type,the%20same%20types%20of%20packaging." target="_blank">Meaning of Plastic Symbols<a><br>Typically you can recycle plastic bottles and containers, food and beverage cans/containers, paper, flattened cardboard, and glass bottles and containers. Unfortunately you cannot recycle plastic bags/wrap/film, flexible packaging, cups/to-go boxes with wax/plastic coating, and polystyrene foam.<br></p>

				<h5>FAQ</h5>
					<div class="dropdown1">
						<span>Why can’t I recycle this, its made of plastic?</span>
						
						<div class="dropdown-content1">
						<p>Some plastic items cannot be recycled because they contain other parts that cannot be recycled, or they are made up of a plastic that can get tangled up in the recycling equipment and damage it, or they are too small and cannot be sorted by recycling equipment.</p>
						
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="dropdown2">
						<span>Can I recycle my disposable mask?</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content2">
						<p>Single use masks especially ones used to protect oneself against infection or viruses like COVID-19 should be thrown in the trash for public health safety. But if you would like to recycle your Protective Personal Gear safely TerraCycle has a <a href="https://www.terracycle.com/en-US/zero_waste_boxes/safety-equipment-and-protective-gear" target="_blank">solution</a>!</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="dropdown3">
						<span>How can I make recycling a habit?</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content3">
						<p>Make yourself a visual poster on what you can/can’t recycle and put in near your recycle bin or print this <a href="https://media.heifer.org/Blog/join-the-conversation/World_Ark_Blog/2019/APRIL/2019_Summer_WA_p6-7_FTR[1].jpg" target="_blank">one</a>. In addition, you can have more recycle bins around your house, seeing them will perhaps make you more motivated to recycle.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="dropdown4">
						<span>Does recycling really help the Earth?</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content4">
						<p>Yes, it does! Especially along with the actions of reducing, reusing, and repurposing items before throwing them away. And while it might seem like a hassle to spend an extra couple seconds of your day rinsing out that plastic container in order to recycle it, maybe try it out for a week and the “hassle” could turn into habit.</a>!</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="dropdown5">
						<span>How can I get my community to recycle?</span>
						<div class="dropdown-content5">
						<p>You can start by educatign yourself about recycling, and share what you learn with your friends and family. If your local restaurants use excessive single use plastics, then you can pitch to them the environmental and economic benefits of using reusable utensils. In addition, you can host a trash pick-up and spread awareness to attendees about properly disposing of waste.</p>

				<h6>About Us</h6>
				<p>We wanted to create this website to offer an educational platform with clear and easy instructions/recommendations on how to recycle and how it's beneficial to the environment! Not everyone has the time or patience to memorize what each number means and where their local recycling facility is, and so we decided to create a “one-stop” recycling page that can locate your nearest local recycling place!</p>
